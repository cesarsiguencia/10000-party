        <h3>Why?...How?...Really?... The True Story</h3>

        <p>
            Every year, the majority of us enjoy celebrating our birthdays in numerous ways. Many of like to go all out with festivities, parties, or gifts. Others like to keep it on the down low and pretend around others that it is not their birthday at all, being incredibly boring and humble in the process.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            For as long as human beings have existed, we have normalized and have created a social construct to celebrate the day we were born on every year as a reminder that we are indeed, getting older. I am all down for celebration. But honestly speaking, the whole "best day of the year" sparkle that birthdays used to have on me has died. Perhaps I am getting too old? Perhaps I'm dull and boring due to the harsh realities that aduliting has caused in my twenties? 

            <br/>
            <br/>

            But then I told myself that it wasn't me. I have gone through many changes, but I am still exuberant and I continue to do the most. It's that the whole birthday celebrations thing has become too repetitive, mundane, and pointless for me. While I do believe they are still important and deserve our attention, I don't believe it's essential to be celebrating our birthdays every single year only to be expecting to be doing the same thing 365 days from now. In other words, it has become predictable and calculated.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            

            I miss giving true meaning to celebration-worthy events, but unfortunately, I haven't genuiely had anything major or unique happen to me that has compelled me to plan a celebration and to enjoy it in a fullfilling manner. I feel that in order for me to really do all that, there has to be an event that is worthy enough to be bestowed with an unforgettable celebration of a lifetime. It must be an important milestone that is unique, special, one of a kind, memoreable, and different. It must be an event that questions the status quo and everything that we formally knew. And above all, it must be an event that is of course, "EXTRA-ordinary" in every possible way to me and to all the fortunate souls that will get to experience this phenomenom and brag about it to their collegues, lovers, and party-hating aquintances. This is that event. 

            <br/>
            <br/>

            But where did all of this come from?

            <br/>
            <br/>

            Once upon a time, my nightly fantasies and thoughts kept me from falling asleep as they occasionally do. As I laid awake that night thinking about my place in the universe or why she likes him and not me, I began thinking about my age and how far I have come as a 25 year old. Then, my curiousity took a turn. I told myself "if I'm 25, then I must be a BILLION seconds old! Wonder how much that would be?" While I was too lazy to do the math on my bed for that, I decided that "seconds is too much, why don't I just count how many days I've lived so far". I then pulled out my phone, went to google to search for date calculator site, entered my birthday down and the date of that day to count the days I have been alive so far. And walah! I got a big number!

            <br/>
            <br/>

            I don't remember what day I was when I made that discovery, but when the website calculated the amount of days I was alive, I was astonished! It was in the realms of 9,500! 

            <br/>
            <br/>

            "So... it looks like I am almost 10,000 days old! I am about to experience almost 10,000 days of life!", I thought! That sounds pretty exciting and cool. But what day will that be? I quickly re-entered my exact birthday and added 10,000 days to the website formula engine, and long and behold, my answer was revealed

            <br/>
            <br/>

            </p>

            <h4>October 21st, 2023</h4>
            <h4>On a Saturday</h4>
            <br/>
            <p>
            

            As if fate already had me destined to celebrate this experience with great people (you) on a day no better than a Saturday, the weekend!

            <br/>
            <br/>

            Many of us have overlooked something like this. And I'm surprised this hasn't become a thing yet. If you are reading this, this is probably the first time you've heard about someone looking forward to 10,000 days of life and is actually going to do something about it on that day. Like... that's so random? Well, let me be the very first to do so then because I know when things are worth the attention of celebration. It really should be a day worth celebrating. It should really be a celebration to bring amazing people like yourself to come spend an important day with me and be appreciative that we can celebrate that day. And I do wish to go all in for this...because no.. I am not going to celebrate hard for my 28th, or even my 30th birthday. Soooo overrated. And yes... I am going to give it my all and thank the Lord for allowing me to experience 10,000 mornings and evenings with the very best of people and make it a night that puts all my previous birthday gatherings to shame. 

            <br/>
            <br/>

            This will be that night to remember.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            And I hope you join me in such a special moment.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            Thank you for taking the time to read about why I am deciding to do this and I hope you are excited about this as I am.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            I cannot wait to see you there!
