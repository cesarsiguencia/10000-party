                <h3>Why?... How?... Really?... The True Story</h3>
                <p>
                    Every year, the majority of us enjoy celebrating our birthdays in numerous ways. For as long as human beings have existed, we have normalized to celebrate that day as a reminder that we are indeed, getting older. I am all down for celebration. But honestly speaking, birthday celebrations have become too repetitive and mundane if the same thing happens every 365 days. In other words, it has
                    become predictable and calculated.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I miss giving true meaning to celebration-worthy events. For me, it has to be an event that is worthy enough of a celebration of a lifetime. An important milestone that is unique, special, one of a kind, and memorable. It must be an event that questions the
                    status quo and everything we know. And above all, it must be an event that is of course,
                    "EXTRA" for me and all fortunate enough to come. This is that event.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But where did all of this come from?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    One night about a year ago, my nightly fantasies and thoughts kept me from falling asleep as they
                    occasionally do. As I laid awake that night thinking about my place in the universe, I
                    began thinking about my age in days. So quickly, I googled a date calculator and no surprise, I got a big number in the realms of 9,500!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    "Wow! That's so close to 10,000 days!" I thought, " So what would that day be...?",
                    I quickly restructured the formula and my answer was
                    revealed
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>

                <div class="equation">
                    <h2>TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 1996</h2>
                    <h2> + </h2>
                    <h2> 10,000 DAYS </h2>
                    <h2> = </h2>
                    <h2>SATURDAY, OCTOBER 21ST, 2023</h2>
                </div>
                <br />
                <p>
                    As if fate already had me destined to celebrate this experience with great people (you) on a day no
                    better
                    than a Saturday, the weekend!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Many of us have overlooked something like this. And I'm surprised this hasn't become a thing yet. This may probably be the first time you've heard about someone doing something for their 10,000th day. Well, let
                    me
                    be
                    the first to do so because I know when things are worth the attention of celebration. And
                    I do
                    wish
                    to
                    go all in for this...because no.. I am not going to celebrate hard for my 28th, or even my 30th
                    birthday.
                    Soooo overrated.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I am going to give it my all and be grateful that I experienced
                    10,000 mornings and evenings and do so with the very best of people and make it a night that puts all my
                    previous
                    birthday gatherings to shame.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This will be that night to remember.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And I hope you join me in such a special moment.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Thank you for taking the time to read about why I am deciding to do this and I hope you are excited
                    about
                    this as I am.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I cannot wait to see you there!
