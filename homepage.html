                <h3>Why?... How?... Really?... The True Story</h3>
                <p>
                    Every year, the majority of us enjoy celebrating our birthdays in numerous ways. Many of like to go
                    all
                    out
                    with festivities, parties, or gifts. Others like to keep it on the down low and pretend around
                    others
                    that
                    it is not their birthday at all, being incredibly boring and humble in the process.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    For as long as human beings have existed, we have normalized and have created a social construct to
                    celebrate the day we were born on every year as a reminder that we are indeed, getting older. I am
                    all
                    down
                    for celebration. But honestly speaking, the whole "best day of the year" sparkle that birthdays used
                    to
                    have
                    on me has died. Perhaps I am getting too old? Perhaps I'm dull and boring due to the harsh realities
                    that
                    aduliting has caused in my twenties?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But then I told myself that it wasn't me. I have gone through many changes, but I am still exuberant
                    and
                    I
                    continue to do the most. It's that the whole birthday celebrations thing has become too repetitive,
                    mundane,
                    and pointless for me. While I do believe they are still important and deserve our attention, I don't
                    believe
                    it's essential to be celebrating our birthdays every single year only to be expecting to be doing
                    the
                    same
                    thing 365 days from now. In other words, it has become predictable and calculated.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I miss giving true meaning to celebration-worthy events, but unfortunately, I haven't genuiely had
                    anything
                    major or unique happen to me that has compelled me to plan a celebration and to enjoy it in a
                    fullfilling
                    manner. I feel that in order for me to really do all that, there has to be an event that is worthy
                    enough to
                    be bestowed with an unforgettable celebration of a lifetime. It must be an important milestone that
                    is
                    unique, special, one of a kind, memoreable, and different. It must be an event that questions the
                    status
                    quo
                    and everything that we formally knew. And above all, it must be an event that is of course,
                    "EXTRA-ordinary"
                    in every possible way to me and to all the fortunate souls that will get to experience this
                    phenomenom
                    and
                    brag about it to their collegues, lovers, and party-hating aquintances. This is that event.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But where did all of this come from?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Once upon a time, my nightly fantasies and thoughts kept me from falling asleep as they occasionally
                    do.
                    As
                    I laid awake that night thinking about my place in the universe or why she likes him and not me, I
                    began
                    thinking about my age and how far I have come as a 25 year old. Then, my curiousity took a turn. I
                    told
                    myself "if I'm 25, then I must be a BILLION seconds old! Wonder how much that would be?" While I was
                    too
                    lazy to do the math on my bed for that, I decided that "seconds is too much, why don't I just count
                    how
                    many
                    days I've lived so far". I then pulled out my phone, went to google to search for date calculator
                    site,
                    entered my birthday down and the date of that day to count the days I have been alive so far. And
                    walah!
                    I
                    got a big number!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I don't remember what day I was when I made that discovery, but when the website calculated the
                    amount
                    of
                    days I was alive, I was astonished! It was in the realms of 9,500!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    "So... it looks like I am almost 10,000 days old! I am about to experience almost 10,000 days of
                    life!",
                    I
                    thought! That sounds pretty exciting and cool. But what day will that be? I quickly re-entered my
                    exact
                    birthday and added 10,000 days to the website formula engine, and long and behold, my answer was
                    revealed
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>

                <div class="equation">
                    <h2>TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 1996</h2>
                    <h2> + </h2>
                    <h2> 10,000 DAYS </h2>
                    <h2> = </h2>
                    <h2>SATURDAY, OCTOBER 21ST, 2023</h2>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    As if fate already had me destined to celebrate this experience with great people (you) on a day no
                    better
                    than a Saturday, the weekend!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Many of us have overlooked something like this. And I'm surprised this hasn't become a thing yet. If
                    you
                    are
                    reading this, this is probably the first time you've heard about someone looking forward to 10,000
                    days
                    of
                    life and is actually going to do something about it on that day. Like... that's so random? Well, let
                    me
                    be
                    the very first to do so then because I know when things are worth the attention of celebration. It
                    really
                    should be a day worth celebrating. It should really be a celebration to bring amazing people like
                    yourself
                    to come spend an important day with me and be appreciative that we can celebrate that day. And I do
                    wish
                    to
                    go all in for this...because no.. I am not going to celebrate hard for my 28th, or even my 30th
                    birthday.
                    Soooo overrated. And yes... I am going to give it my all and thank the Lord for allowing me to
                    experience
                    10,000 mornings and evenings with the very best of people and make it a night that puts all my
                    previous
                    birthday gatherings to shame.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This will be that night to remember.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And I hope you join me in such a special moment.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Thank you for taking the time to read about why I am deciding to do this and I hope you are excited
                    about
                    this as I am.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I cannot wait to see you there!
